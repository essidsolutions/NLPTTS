# NLPTTS
NLPTTS is a technical testing project for the new joiner at ESSID SOLUTIONS

### Introduction 
The project consists of creating a voice cloning/ voice synthesizer that processes a video and changes the original voice with the user's voice 

### Architecture 
The High-level Architecture is to convert a video file by changing the speaker's voice with the user's voice,

### Task 
- Choose a set of videos with the same or different speakers and different accents (preferred English)
- Choose your voice as the user's voice input 
- Architect the Solutions
- Write The Code.
- Execute the process.
- Analyse the output 

In the end, you should be having your voice on the video as you are the original speaker.

### Conclusion 
We want to understand your logic in approaching this test, so we ask you kindly to specify the architecture and commit any changes or code to this repository 
You can find the attached drawing that explains the process
